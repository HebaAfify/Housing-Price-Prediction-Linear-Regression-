Use one-hot encoding to transform categorical columns into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

#32-detect-missing-values
Identify and handle missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques.

#33-data-visualization
Visualize data to better understand its distribution, patterns, and potential outliers.

#34-dealing-with-outliers
Apply log transformation to handle outliers in the dataset.

#35-correlation-analysis
Explore correlations between features and visualize them using a heatmap.

#4-model-training-and-evaluation
#41-training-with-xgboost
Train a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm.

#42-training-with-linear-regression
Train a linear regression model as an alternative predictive model.

#43-models-evaluation
Evaluate the performance of both models using relevant metrics and visualizations.

#5-feature-engineering
