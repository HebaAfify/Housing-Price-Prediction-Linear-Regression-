## 1. Setup and Importing Data

This section involves setting up the Python environment and importing the necessary libraries. It also includes loading the dataset that will be used for predicting housing prices.

## 2. Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the data. This step is crucial for understanding the features and their relationships.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

### 3.1 Encode Categorical Columns

Use one-hot encoding to transform categorical columns into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### 3.2 Detect Missing Values

Identify and handle missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques.

### 3.3 Data Visualization

Visualize data to better understand its distribution, patterns, and potential outliers.

### 3.4 Dealing with Outliers

Apply log transformation to handle outliers in the dataset.

### 3.5 Correlation Analysis

Explore correlations between features and visualize them using a heatmap.

## 4. Model Training and Evaluation

### 4.1 Training with XGBoost

Train a predictive model using the XGBoost algorithm.

### 4.2 Training with Linear Regression

Train a linear regression model as an alternative predictive model.

### 4.3 Models Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of both models using relevant metrics and visualizations.

## 5. Feature Engineering

Explore and implement feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of the models.
